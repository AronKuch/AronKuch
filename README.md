Hi, Iâ€™m @AronKuch ðŸ‘‹ 
- Iâ€™m interested in way too much. This year has brought much research into oncology, which became very personal, yet I'm also highly facinated by it. I also have a passion for servant-leadership management and workplaces that are emotionally healthy as well as high performing.
- Technologically, I have spent most of my career intrepreting data. Occasionally I get to test the waters of programmming. Iâ€™m currently learning React, and DevOps concepts outside of GitHub.
- Reach me via LinkedIn.
